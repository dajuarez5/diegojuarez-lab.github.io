title: "Advanced Study of Nickel-Titanium Alloy: Effects of Point Defects on Mechanical and Thermodynamic Properties" 
excerpt: "High-throughput first-principles calculations of point defects are emerging as a powerful tool to accelerate materials discovery in applications. Substitutional, antisite, and vacancy defects can play an important role in the mechanical and thermal  properties of intermetallic alloys.  
In this present work I compute the thermal and mechanical properties of shape-memory alloy nickel-titaniun (NiTi) in 
the B19’ martensitic and B2 austenitic phases from molecular dynamics (MD), using a second nearest neighbor (2NN)
modified embedded atom method (MEAM) classical potential in the temperature range from 200K to 600K 
and composition range from 45 atomic percent to 55 atomic percent nickel. We developed and used a python framework 
to generate input files, run the simulations, and analyze the data, which we call Utilities To Execute Pipelines (UTEP).
Thirty-nine lattice parameters and five temperatures were simulated for eleven distinct compositions around equiatomicity,
for antisite defects each with three distinct defect concentrations on 16,000-atom supercells, meanwhile for vacancy defects 
each with three distinct defect concentrations, for a total of 45,045 MD simulations of 2000 time steps each with a time step 
size of 5 fs. We extracted temperature-dependent materials parameters from fits to the internal energies by fitting the 
Birch-Murnaghan equation of state. Thermodynamic properties such as the vibrational entropy were obtained using two 
different approaches from the materials parameters the first one was using the Moruzzi-Janak-Schwarz 
 approximation and secondly from the integration de of the density of states and the Bose-Einstein statics. Finally, the configurational entropy due to the defects was obtained from the Warren-Cowley parameters up to fourth nearest neighbors. Defects are energetically unfavorable,
but can become thermodynamically stabilized at high temperature, particularly on the nickel-rich side. 
The bulk modulus decreases with temperature in the nickel-rich side, while the opposite is observed on the 
titanium-rich side. <br/><img src='/images/500x300.png'>"
